**Plot 1  (Title in Screenshot)**


In this scatterplot, I decided to graph how the average rating of an Episode of the Netflix show *Narcos*(which was given in my [data](http://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=narcos&embed=episodes)), changed over the course of the show. I feel like generally, shows tend to get worse over their lifetime, but Narcos clearly does a good job of staying entertaining throughout all 3 seasons, although there seems to be a bit more variance in audience enjoyment through the third season. One thing I found interesting was that it appears like the episodes tend to get more enjoyable over the course of an individual season.

**Plot 2 (Title in Screenshot)**


For this plot, I used a bar graph to compare the percentage of episode titles in Narcos and street names in San Francisco ([data for the latter here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/street-names)) that start with the letters A, T, and S. One thing I found very interesting about this data was that the letter "T" was extremeley common in episode names, but very common in street names. This is probably due to many episodes beginning with the word "the".
